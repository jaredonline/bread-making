# Apricot Cranberry Sourdough - Mar 12, 2022

## Leaven 

I've never done this before, but I did a twice-fed leaven for this. I've been having some issues recently with oven-spring and overall rise, so I consulted my trusty Tartine Bread Book and took their suggestion to re-feed the leaven if it's older than 12 hours.

### Leaven One

| Ingredient  | Amount | Other | Baker's Percentage |
|:-------------|:--------|:-------|:--------------------|
| Starter     | 50g    |       | 16.7%               |
| Water       | 300g   | 107F  | 100%              |
| 50/50 Flour | 300g   |       | 100%              |

### Leaven Two

The Tartine book says to discard half the first leaven and then add then feed it with 50% water and 50% 50/50 flour.

| Ingredient  | Amount | Other |
|:-------------|:--------|:-------|
| Leaven One     | 350g    |       |
| Water       | 150g   | 107F  | 
| 50/50 Flour | 150g   |       |

## Notes

One of the best loaves I've made to date. Amazing and even crumb, very light but chewy crust and very good taste. The dough is very mild from a sour-perspective
