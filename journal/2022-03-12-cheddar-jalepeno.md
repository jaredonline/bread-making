# Cheddar Jalepe単o Sourdough - Mar 12, 2022

## Leaven 

I did a hybrid leaven for this dough which means I added some baker's yeast to the final dough. Last time I made the Cheddar Jalepe単o it didn't spring very well, so this was to help with that. It also uses a less mature leaven that was mixed the morning of mixing the dough.
