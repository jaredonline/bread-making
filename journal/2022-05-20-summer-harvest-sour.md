# Summer Harvest Sourdough - May 19/20, 2022

## Leaven 

My original plan was to make the dough on 5/19, so I made a leaven on the night of 5/18, like normal. But when it came to it, I didn't feel like making bread on 5/19. So I fed the leaven around 3p on 5/19 and then again around 220p on 5/20.

## Notes

One of the best loaves I've made to date. Amazing and even crumb, very light but chewy crust and very good taste. The dough is very mild from a sour-perspective
