# Method

I primarily bake with leavened breads, which means I don't usually add any commercial yeast. I keep a starter that I feed daily, and make a leaven two days before I want to bake, and that's the rising agent in the bread. There's nothing wrong with commercial yeast, but I think leavened bread tastes better.

## Flour Water Salt Yeast and Tartine

My method is a combination of Ken Forkish's method in [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=flour+water+salt+yeast&qid=1549643780&s=Books&sr=1-1) and Chad Robertson's [Tartine Bread](https://www.amazon.com/Tartine-Bread-Chad-Robertson/dp/0811870413/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536611333&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=tartine+bread&psc=1).

If you're just getting started I recommend Flour Water Salt Yeast as your first book. It has much better instructions and photographs. It also includes some recipes for non-leavened breads, which can be much easier for your first few bakes. There's fewer variables and fewer things that can go wrong.

## Method 

Here's how I do it.

### Starter

I keep a [starter](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/recipes/starter.md) on my counter. I feed it once a day, usually in the morning, around 10a.

### Two days before I want bread

Two days before I want to bake, I make a leaven. I usually do this around 10p. Here's my [generic leaven recipe](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/recipes/leaven.md).

### The day before I want bread

The next day I mix the dough. I usually mix it around noon or 1p. My general process is:

1. Mix the dough in mixer, holding back the salt and 50g of the water.
2. Autolyse for 40m
3. Add salt and water, mixing by hand
4. Transfer to bulk fermentation container
5. Do 3 folds in the first 45m, spaced out by 15m each
6. Do 2 more folds, spaced out by 30m each.
7. Continue to bulk for 3-7 hours
8. Divide
9. Initial shape
10. Bench rest for 30m
11. Final shape
12. Proof in fridge in proofing baskets overnight

### The day of bread

Then the next morning I bake. I usually do this early in the morning, around 8a, which means I turn the oven on around 7a.

1. Fire up oven to 500F with dutch oven in it
2. After the oven comes to temp, let dutch oven sit for additional 20m to heat
3. Pull the loaf from the fridge, dump out on bread peel
4. Score loaf
5. Remove dutch oven from oven, add loaf, put back in oven
6. Bake for 20m
7. Remove dutch oven lid
8. Bake for 10m
9. Lower temp to 475F
10. Bake for 10m
11. Remove from dutch oven
12. Cool on wire rack for 30m

## Adjustments

The above is my _general_ outline. I make adjustments for each batch as I go, depending on how the dough is responding. Ken Forkish talks about how **time** and **temperature** are two of your main ingredients during the bulk fermentation and proofing phases. The temperature in my kitchen can vary by quite a bit, which means the timings can change.

## Quantity

Most of the recipes don't list actual volumes or weights of ingredients to use. They list [Baker's Percentages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_percentage). I generally make 1kg loaves because they fit in my 8.5" baskets well, bake in 40m and fit in my oven. I believe that ~1kg is a standard size loaf. To do that, most of my recipes have 1000g of flour in them, which make two loaves. I frequently double my recipes to make four loaves.

## Journal

I came up with this outline by baking dozens of loaves following Ken Forkish's and Chad Robertson's methods, keeping notes about how it was going. Over time I started changing small things and seeing how the outcome changed. I would encourage you to keep a journal as well. Everyone's kitchen and oven are slightly different, so my outline won't be your outline.
