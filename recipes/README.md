## Breads

- [Pain au Levain](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/recipes/pal.md) - super basic but delicious sour bread
- [Hard Red](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/recipes/hard-red.md) - slightly more flavorful version of the Pain au Levain
- [Sprouted Quinoa](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/recipes/sprouted-quinoa.md) - A Pain au Levain with sprouted quinoa. Very hearty and earthy
