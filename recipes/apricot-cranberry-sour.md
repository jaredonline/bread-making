# Apricot Cranberry Sourdough

While visiting Tucson recently we had [Barrio Bread's](https://www.barriobread.com/) delicious Apricot Cranberry Sourdough. When we got home we wanted more so I gave it a go; here's the recipe I came up with.

## Prep

Cut the apricots into smaller chunks, about 1/4's.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  | 2 ~1kg loaves |
|---|--:|---|
| White bread flour  | 80%  | 800g |
| Whole wheat flour  |  20% | 200g |
|  Water | 77%  | 770g |
| Sweetened Dried Cranberries | 25% | 250g |
| Dried Apricots | 25% | 250g |
| Leaven | 20% | 200g |
| Salt | 2% | 20g |

## Notes

Add the apricot and cranberry with the salt or right before you do your first fold.
