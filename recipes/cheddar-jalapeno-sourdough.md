# Cheddar Jalapeño Sourdough

I came up with this recipe from [this article](https://www.piesandtacos.com/cheddar-jalapeno-sourdough-bread/), loosely. I took the baker's percentage of total fillings from it (40%) and divided it into what I thought was a reasonable ratio. It's a delicious, cheesy bread with a little bit of kick from the jalapeño.

## Prep

Not much, chop the cheese into 1/2" cubes and small dice the jalapeño (make sure to remove all the seeds).

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  | 2 ~1kg loaves |
|---|--:|---|
| White bread flour  | 90%  | 900g |
| Whole wheat flour  |  10% | 100g |
|  Water | 75%  | 750g |
| Cheddar | 36% | 360g |
| Jalapeño | 4% | 40g |
| Leaven | 25% | 250g |
| Salt | 2% | 20g |

## Notes

Add the cheddar and jalapeño right before you do your first fold.

You can adjust the amount of jalapeño in the recipe to suit your taste for spice. The 4% I used had only the tiniest _hint_ of pepper flavor.

Different cheddars have different amounts of fat in them, so play with the cheese you use and the amount you use. I wouldn't go over 40% for the cheddar though, I think it'll make it too hard for the bread to get a good oven spring.
