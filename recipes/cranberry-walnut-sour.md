# Apricot Cranberry Sourdough

While visiting Tucson recently we had [Barrio Bread's](https://www.barriobread.com/) delicious Cranberry Walnut Sourdough. When we got home we wanted more so I gave it a go; here's the recipe I came up with.

## Prep

Cut the walnuts into medium chunks.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  | 2 ~1kg loaves |
|---|--:|---|
| White bread flour  | 80%  | 800g |
| Whole wheat flour  |  20% | 200g |
|  Water | 77%  | 770g |
| Sweetened Dried Cranberries |  | 1.5c |
| Walnut chunks |  | 1.5 cups |
| Leaven | 20% | 200g |
| Salt | 2% | 20g |

## Notes

Add the cranberry and walnut with the salt or right before you do your first fold. I didn't bother weighing the cranberry and walnut; I just used some measuring cups to get a rough idea of how much I put in.

## Method

Follow the [general method](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/method.md)
