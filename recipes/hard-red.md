# Hard Red

This is essentially a Pain au Levain with some hard red flour added. It makes for a more complex flavor profile and a little bit more bite.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  | 2 ~1kg loaves |
|---|--:|---|
| White bread flour  | 80%  | 800g |
| Whole wheat flour  |  10% | 100g |
| Hard red flour | 10% | 100g |
|  Water | 75%  | 750g |
| Leaven | 20-25% | 200-250g |
| Salt | 2% | 20g |

## Notes

The leaven is a range because you can add more or less leaven to change the flavor. If you want it more sour, add more. Keep in mind you'll have to reduce the bulk fermentation time because there will be more yeast and they'll run out of food faster.
