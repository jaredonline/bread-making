# Leaven

The leaven is essentially a starter feeding with more food than normal, and done at an off cycle.

## Recipe

This is my generic leaven recipe. Some bread recipes call for a more specific leaven. I usually make it around 10p two nights before I want to make bread. See the [general method](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/method.md) for more info.

1. In a fresh tub (4 quart is fine), combine:
  1. 30-40g of starter
  2. 200g starter food (100g of white bread flour and 100g of whole wheat)
  3. 200g of ~115F water
  4. Stir
  5. Cover and let sit on the counter over night

That's it! The yeast will be stoked on how much fresh food they have and will start producing delicious leaven flavors over night. I usually let it sit until noon the next day at the earliest. 

## Knowing its ready

Ken Forkish has a test he calls the "float test" for a leaven. The idea is you take a small amount of your leaven and drop it in warm water. If it floats, it's ready to use. In practice this is harder to do than it sounds. When you scoop the leaven out, you need to be very delicate, otherwise you'll destroy the structure that holds the CO2 that makes it float, and your leaven will sink, even though its ready. I usually look for growth. When the leaven is 2-3x bigger than it started, I say its good to go.
