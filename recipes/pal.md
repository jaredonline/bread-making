# Pain au Levain

I have no idea if that's the right spelling. I think it's supposed to be french for Leavened Bread. This is a rustic sourdough bread with an enormous amount of flexibility in flavor. You can let your starter or leaven go for longer or shorter periods of time to control the sourness of the bread, and you can add different types of flours for different flavor profiles.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  |
|---|--:|
| White bread flour  | 90%  |
| Whole wheat flour  |  10% |
|  Water | 75%  |
| Leaven | 20-25% |
| Salt | 2% |

## Notes

The leaven is a range because you can add more or less leaven to change the flavor. If you want it more sour, add more. Keep in mind you'll have to reduce the bulk fermentation time because there will be more yeast and they'll run out of food faster.
