# Sprouted Quinoa

I got this recipe from [a baker named Adam](https://www.instagram.com/season_adam/). It's a delicious, hearty, earthy bread with a little bit of sour to it.

## Prep

You need to sprout the quinoa the day before you make the dough (the same day you make the leaven). Early evening (around 6 or 7, if you're following my method), soak ~200g of quinoa in boiling water for about 2 hours. Drain the quinoa, put on a plate, and cover in a few dish towels over night. The quinoa should just barely start sprouting a tail by the time you need to bake with them.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient  | Baker's Percentage  | 2 ~1kg loaves |
|---|--:|---|
| White bread flour  | 90%  | 900g |
| Whole wheat flour  |  10% | 100g |
|  Water | 75%  | 750g |
| Quinoa | 20% | 200g |
| Leaven | 20% | 200g |
| Salt | 2% | 20g |

## Notes

Add the quinoa when you add the salt and last 50g of water, after the autolyse.
