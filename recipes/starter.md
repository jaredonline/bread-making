# Starter

I have a very simple starter recipe. A lot of blogs and tutorials have complicated systems for getting a starter going, but I've found that's not necessary. This mostly from [Tartine Bread](https://github.com/jaredonline/bread-making/blob/master/tools.md#books), with some small adaptions.

## Starting the starter

Starting the starter is essentially the same as feeding the starter, just missing the first step.

1. Heat water to ~115F. Plus or minus a couple degrees is fine, yeast are resilient buggers.
2. Combine 200g of water with 100g of white bread flour and 100g of whole wheat bread flour
3. Stir
4. Cover and let sit until the next day

## Feeding the starter

Same as above, except some values change, and you start off by throwing half of your starter away.

1. Discard 200g of starter
2. Heat water to ~115F
3. Add to your starter: 100g of water, 50g of white bread flour and 50g of whole wheat bread flour
4. Stir
5. Cover and let sit until the next day

You'll do this every day from now on while you want to keep a starter.

## Knowing when its ready

After a few days you'll start to notice that your starter is generating bubbles. It will also start growing and shrinking through the day. My general rule of thumb is when it smells like a fruity alcohol, it's ready to go. It'll be very bubbly and should double in size every day before shrinking back down to its original size over night.

## Counter versus fridge

A lot of folks like to keep their starter in the fridge so they don't have to feed it as often. I've never had success with that, but I know a lot of folks have. You can totally experiment with this, but I keep my starter on my kitchen counter.

As a side note, I keep mine on a wooden cutting board that I keep out on the counter. My counters are granite, and granite is cold. Cold is the enemy of active yeast. If your starter seems less active than it should, try insulating it somehow.

## Flour mix

Instead of measuring out 50g of two types of flour every day, I buy a 5lb bag of white bread flour and a 5lb bag of whole wheat flour and combine them in a 12 quart tub. I mix them together real good, and then feed the starter with 100g of that every day.
