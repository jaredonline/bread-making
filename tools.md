Here's a rough list of the things I use to make bread. **Note: None of these links are affiliate links**. I'm not making any money off this, just providing links for convenience.

## Tubs

I really like plastic tubs for bread making.

[2 quart round](https://breadtopia.com/store/dough-rising-and-storage-bucket-2-quart/) - For keeping my starter in and making my leaven
[8 quart rectangle flat](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/cambro-26cw135-camwear-1-2-size-clear-food-pan-6-deep/21426CWCL.html?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIieCz89ms4AIVlcJkCh1paQHIEAQYBSABEgL_r_D_BwE) - For the bulk phase
[12 quart round](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/cambro-rfs12pp190-12-qt-translucent-round-storage-container/214RFS12PP.html) - For keeping my starter food in

## Mixer

I use a [Kitchen Aid](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kitchenaid-pro-line-stand-mixer-7-quart/?catalogId=60&sku=1564509&cm_ven=PLA&cm_cat=Google&cm_pla=Electrics%20%3E%20Mixers%20%26%20Attachments%20%3E%20Stand%20Mixers&cm_ite=1564509&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIldOwjtqs4AIVsR-tBh1_ugqfEAQYAiABEgIqO_D_BwE) 7qt Pro with the bread hook for mixing, but you can mix the bread in the plastic bulking tub by hand with [dough scrapers](https://breadtopia.com/store/dr-oetker-dough-scraper/) or with your hands (that's how [Ken Forkish](#books) recommends, but not what I do).

## Proofing baskets

[Round 8.5in baskets](https://breadtopia.com/store/bread-proofing-basket/) - I use round ones because I make boules. I think they're easier to shape and fit in a normal round dutch oven best

## Dutch Oven

[6-7qt Dutch Oven](https://shop.lodgemfg.com/dutch-ovens-and-casseroles/6-qt-dutch-ovens.asp) - I bake in a Lodge dutch oven. It keeps the steam and heat in and creates a very nice crust. Make sure you get one where the lit has a metal handle, otherwise it will melt.

## Lame

[Normal ass lame](https://breadtopia.com/store/bread-lame/) - for scoring the bread

## Towels

[Linen towels](https://www.etsy.com/listing/497384570/linen-hand-towels-small-set-of-5-plain?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=linen+towels&ref=sr_gallery-1-8&organic_search_click=1&col=1) - for covering the dough in the autolyse, bench rest and proofing phases. Lint free is super important.

## Bread peel

[Bread peel](https://breadtopia.com/store/cherry-pizza-peel/) - Some people turn their bread out of the proofing baskets directly into their dutch ovens and score it inside the dutch oven. I turn my onto a peel and score it there, then transfer it by hand to the dutch oven. I do this because I'm scared shitless out of burning my arm on the dutch oven while scoring the dough.

## Bench Knife

[Bench Knife](https://breadtopia.com/store/lamsonsharp-bench-knife/) - This isn't the exact bench knife that I use, but that's not important. Find one that is comfortable for you to hold. This is used for dividing and shaping the dough.

## Books

- [Flour Water Salt Yeast](https://www.amazon.com/Flour-Water-Salt-Yeast-Fundamentals/dp/160774273X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=flour+water+salt+yeast&qid=1549643780&s=Books&sr=1-1) - Fantastic and practical book about making artisan bread at home. Everyone who wants to get into bread making should start here.
- [Tartine Bread](https://www.amazon.com/Tartine-Bread-Chad-Robertson/dp/0811870413/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1536611333&sr=1-1-spons&keywords=tartine+bread&psc=1) - This is a much more academic take at bread making than Flour Water Salt Yeast, but has some really in depth and fantastic information. As a cook book, its fairly awful. But its a great resource once you don't need the step-by-step anymore. It also has some fantastic recipes in it.
- [Dough](https://www.amazon.com/Dough-Simple-Contemporary-Richard-Bertinet/dp/1909487538/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=dough+by+richard&qid=1549649402&s=Books&sr=1-1) - This book has some interesting recipes, but uses a totally different method. In my opinion, it isn't well suited to home baking. The crust and crumb aren't well developed, and the flavors for the basic whites aren't there. In my personal recipe section, I've adapted many of his flavors for use with FWSY and Tartine methods and had pretty good results.
